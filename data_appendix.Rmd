# Appendix description
*Your Data Appendix should begin with a brief statement explaining its purpose like the following one.*

This Data Appendix documents the data used in "Paper Title". It was prepared in a Rmarkdown document that contains both the documentation and the R code used to prepare the data used in the final estimation. It also includes descriptive statistics for both the original data and the final dataset, with a discussion of any issues of note.

The datasets used directly by the final analysis are saved in `processed-data/` at the end of this file.

# Instructions for Use

To start creating your own data appendix, follow these steps: 

1. Replace the title and author in the section at the top of the file (called the YAML).
1. Commit your changes with a message like "customizing data appendix".
1. Delete this instruction section of the document.
1. Remove any other instructions in italics and examples from the completed sections of the document.

Remember that you will submit your assignment by committing and then pushing your versions to your repository. I encourage you to commit your changes often as you work, but there are three specific points at which you need to both submit and push changes, corresponding to course deadlines:

1. You must submit a version with the original data section completed by the Data Appendix 1 deadline. This will include the .Rmd file, the .pdf file, and the html data summary files stored in the output folder.
2. You must submit a version with all parts completed by the Data Appendix 2 deadline.  
3. You must submit a final version of this document that is consistent with your final paper by the final project deadline.  

While creating your data appendix, refer regularly to the assignment descriptions posted on Moodle.

A few tips:

- When creating a list like this one, be sure to put an empty line above the list. If you don't do this, your entries won't be formatted a list.
- Make sure you have empty lines above and below section and subsection headings.
- When creating numbered lists, you can number all items in your list with 1. Rmarkdown will number them sequentially when it creates your final document.

# Raw data
*Each dataset you use will have its own documentation section. The next subsection in this document (Dataset description) is a template. You can copy this section and paste it into your document each time you need to add a section for a new dataset. Note that each line in the Dataset description section __must__ end with two spaces.* 
This section documents the datasets used in this analysis.

## Household Survey data
**Citation:** .  
Instituto Nacional de Estadistica. (2005). Encuesta de Hogares (2005) [SAV file]. Retrieved from https://www.ine.gob.bo/index.php/banco/base-de-datos-sociales

**Date Downloaded:** Downloaded September 2019.
**Filename(s):** raw_data/filename.csv *If you have a large number of files you can use a patten (see visit data below)*
**Unit of observation:** Unit of observation at the individual level, but each individual is identified mainly by the household id. 
**Dates covered:** 2005 

### To obtain a copy

This household survey can be found on the Bolivian National Statistical Institute website, under the menu for 'Banco de Datos' and 'Base de datos de encuestas sociales.' Then the household surveys may be found for the years 2005-2018, excepting 2010.

### Importable version (if necessary)

**Filename(s):** importable-data/filename-importable.csv

The original format of this data was from the sav file, but I imported it into Stata before importing the Stata format into R.

### Variable descriptions

Create a bullet list with the name of each variable in the dataset followed by any information the user would need to understand it.

- **hh_id:** This variable is the household ID, which is the same for each member of the household. It is made up of letters and numbers. 
- **nro1:** Description of second variable.
- **assist:** 
- **urb_rur:** 
- **reason:** 
- **members:** 
- **sex:** 
- **age:** 
- **relation:** 
- **literacy:** 
- **register:**
- **grade:** 
- **repeated:** 
- **dept:** 


### Data import code and summary

```{r import household data}
data_2005 <- read_dta(file.path("Raw data","seminar_paper_data","2005_hhsurvey.dta")) %>% 
  rename(hh_id = folio,
        assist = s3_08,  
        reason = s3_09, 
        members = nm_y,
        sex = s1_02,
        age = s1_03,
        relation = s1_05,
        literacy = s3_01,
        register = s3_04,
        grade = s3_05b,
        repeated = s3_07,
        dept = depto)
hh_2005 <- data_2005 %>% 
  select(hh_id, assist, reason, members, sex, age, relation, literacy, register, grade, repeated, dept)
```



```{r exporting data table}
export_summary_table(dfSummary(hh_2005))
```

## Flood data
**Citation:** Put citation here in APA or other consistent format that you will use throughout the project. Include a hyperlink if applicable.  
**DOI:** If the dataset has a documention identified (DOI) assigned put it here.  
**Date Downloaded:** Identify when you downloaded the dataset.  
**Filename(s):** raw_data/filename.csv *If you have a large number of files you can use a patten (see visit data below)*
**Unit of observation:** What distinguishes different rows in your dataset?  
**Dates covered:** What time frame does the data cover?  

### To obtain a copy

Describe in a step-by-step fashion how an interested user could obtain the data.

### Importable version (if necessary)

**Filename(s):** importable-data/filename-importable.csv

In some cases the raw data is not directly importable. In this case, you should fully document every step you took to create the importable data in a subsection like this one. 

### Variable descriptions

Create a bullet list with the name of each variable in the dataset followed by any information the user would need to understand it.

- **variable_name:** Variable description. 
- **variable_name2:** Description of second variable.

flood <- read_csv(file.path("Raw data", "recurrencia_inundacion2002_2012bol.csv")) %>% 
  rename(dept = NOM_DEP, flood = A_2005)

##Note: I can't tell completely but it appears that the file you're reading in has all the weather data. Once you load the data onto GitHub, I can help you figure out how to use pivot_longer() to reshape the weather data.

flood_summary %>% weather %>% 
  group_by(dept) %>% 
  summarise(flood = sum(flood))

`export_summary_table(dfSummary(flood_summary))`
```

```{r importing droughts data, echo = F, message = F}
#drought data set 
drought <- read_csv("Raw data\\recurrenciasequia_2002_2012bol.csv")
# modify this section following the template with the flood data, but wait until we've gotten the pivot_longer() function working so you don't duplicate effort.
#rename variables
drought <- rename(weather, c(NOM_DEP = "dept"))
drought <- rename(weather, c(A_2005 = "drought"))

library(dplyr)
drought %>% 
  group_by(dept) %>% 
  summarise(drought = sum(drought))

```

# Data Processing and Combination
*This section should include a discussion of the processing and merging steps needed to create your basic data. The code to implement these steps should be included in chunks in this section. Once the final merged data has been created, you should use the dfSummary function again to summarize the data you will be using. You should also save a file containing all the objects you will use in your final analysis to the processed_data folder.*

```{r merging datasets}
#I would recommend combining all the years of household data and then merging with the weather data

total_2005 <- hh_2005 %>% 
  left_join(flood_summary)
```

```

# Analysis Variables

This section should include a description of all the variables that are used in your final analysis. At the end of the section, you should save all of these variables in the processed_data folder of your repository.

# Discussion of Data

*This section should include a discussion of any data patterns you notice based on the summaries created in the code above.*
