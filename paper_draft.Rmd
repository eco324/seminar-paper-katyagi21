## Data

The household data was taken from the social surveys database of the Bolivia National Statistical Institute, using household surveys from the years 2005-2007, 2011-2012.
Instituto Nacional de Estadistica. (2005). Encuesta de Hogares (2005) [SAV file]. Retrieved from https://www.ine.gob.bo/index.php/banco/base-de-datos-sociales

The unit of observation at the individual level, but each individual is identified mainly by the household id.

The flood data is from the years 2005-2012. The unit of observation is municipality, but the data is later combined to make the unit of observation at the department level to make it comparable with the household survey data.

This data can be found at the following website: http://geosinager.defensacivil.gob.bo/maps/226. It is associated with a map showing the flood occurrences information spatially, and to get the data in a non-spatial format, the flood layer should be downloaded. It may be downloaded in a variety of different formats, including csv.

```{r import flood data, echo = F, message = F}
flood <- read_csv(file.path("Raw data", "recurrencia_inundacion2002_2012bol.csv")) %>% 
  rename(dept = NOM_DEP)

flood_summary <- flood %>% 
  group_by(dept) %>% 
  summarize_at(vars(starts_with("A_")), sum) %>% 
  pivot_longer(-dept, names_to = "year", names_prefix = "A_", values_to = "floods") %>%
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))

#library(DataCombine)
#flood_lags <- slide(flood_summary, Var = "floods", slideBy = -1)


export_summary_table(dfSummary(flood_summary))

```
The drought data also spans the years 2005-2012 and shows the frequency of droughts in each municipality by year.

This data can be obtained from http://geosinager.defensacivil.gob.bo/maps/225. It is shown on a map with different layers, and the raw data may be downloaded in a variety of different forms, including csv.

## Analysis Variables

The variables used in the final analysis are the variables from the flood and drought summaries, showing the number of occurrences in each department per year. The other variables used are from the household data, showing demographic information as well as the dependent variables related to school assistance and registration. The variables "assist" and "register" tell whether the child is currently registered and attending school, and the variables "grade" and "literacy" give further educational information showing what grade the child is in and whether they can read and write. The variables "urb_rur" and "dept" give geographic information, indicating whether the child's household is located in an urban area or a rural area and in what department of the country they are living. Demographic variables such as age, sex, relation to the head of household, number of household members, and income can be used in the analysis as controls.

# Discussion of Data

The "assist" variable shows that around 60% of people who are registered for school currently assist, while 40% do not assist. The "reason" variable shows that two most common reasons for missing school are for work (31.3%) or vacation (20.5). Out of the people who are registered for school, 6.6% are repeating the grade they are currently in. 

The patterns for households show that the average household has 5.3 members, and the average per capita monthly income per household is 258 bolivianos. Over half of the households in the sample are located in urban areas (56.3), while under half are located in rural areas (43.7). La Paz, Santa Cruz, and Cochabamba are the three departments with the most households in this sample, which corresponds to their overall population distribution.

The patterns in the weather data show that every department experienced multiple floods in 2005, while many but not all experienced droughts. The place that experienced the highest number of flood occurrences overall was Cochabamba, while Beni experienced 13 droughts in 2005.
