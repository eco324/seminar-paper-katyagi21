# Appendix description
This data appendix details the steps of collecting, processing, and merging the data needed to create the complete data set showing information about schooling and weather events. It concludes with a discussion of patterns found in the data.

The datasets used directly by the final analysis are saved in `processed-data/` at the end of this file.

#drought data set 
library(readxl)
drought <- read_excel(file.path("Raw data", "recurrenciasequia_2002_2012bol (1).xls")) %>% 
#rename variables
    rename(dept = NOM_DEP)

drought_summary <- drought %>%
  group_by(dept) %>% 
  summarize_at(vars(starts_with("A_")), sum) %>%
  pivot_longer(-dept, names_to = "year", names_prefix = "A_", values_to = "droughts") %>%
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))

export_summary_table(dfSummary(drought_summary))

```

# Data Processing and Combination

To create a complete dataset, I merged the household data with the floods data and the droughts data. Before merging the data, I cut down the datasets to include only the relevant variables needed for analysis in each file. I renamed several variables in the household survey data set to make them more understandable. I also created the year variable for the household data to ensure that it matched up correctly with the weather data. For the flood and drought data, I grouped the occurrences by department instead of by municipality so they would match the household data, and I made the department character numeric for the merge. 


``` {r merging datasets}
total_2005 <- hh_2005 %>% 
  left_join(flood_summary) %>%
  left_join(drought_summary)

export_summary_table(dfSummary(total_2005))

save("total_2005", file = "processed_data/analysis_data.RData")

```



# Analysis Variables

The variables used in the final analysis are the variables from the flood and drought summaries, showing the number of occurrences in each department per year. The other variables used are from the household data, showing demographic information as well as the dependent variables related to school assistance and registration. The variables "assist" and "register" tell whether the child is currently registered and attending school, and the variables "grade" and "literacy" give further educational information showing what grade the child is in and whether they can read and write. The variables "urb_rur" and "dept" give geographic information, indicating whether the child's household is located in an urban area or a rural area and in what department of the country they are living. Demographic variables such as age, sex, relation to the head of household, number of household members, and income can be used in the analysis as controls.


# Discussion of Data

The "assist" variable shows that around 60% of people who are registered for school currently assist, while 40% do not assist. The "reason" variable shows that two most common reasons for missing school are for work (31.3%) or vacation (20.5). Out of the people who are registered for school, 6.6% are repeating the grade they are currently in. 

The patterns for households show that the average household has 5.3 members, and the average per capita monthly income per household is 258 bolivianos. Over half of the households in the sample are located in urban areas (56.3), while under half are located in rural areas (43.7). La Paz, Santa Cruz, and Cochabamba are the three departments with the most households in this sample, which corresponds to their overall population distribution.

The patterns in the weather data show that every department experienced multiple floods in 2005, while many but not all experienced droughts. The place that experienced the highest number of flood occurrences overall was Cochabamba, while Beni experienced 13 droughts in 2005.
